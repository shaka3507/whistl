      "title": "During a Tornado",
      "content": "## If You're Inside\n\n- Go to your pre-designated safe room (basement, storm cellar, or interior room on the lowest floor)\n- Stay away from windows, doors, and outside walls\n- Get under a sturdy piece of furniture and use your arms to protect your head and neck\n- Do not open windows (it doesn't equalize pressure; it just lets in damaging winds)\n\n## If You're in a Mobile Home\n\n- Get out immediately and go to the lowest floor of a nearby building or a storm shelter\n- Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes\n\n## If You're Outside\n\n- Seek shelter in a basement, shelter, or sturdy building\n- If you can't quickly walk to a shelter, immediately get into a vehicle and try to drive to the closest sturdy shelter\n- If flying debris occurs while you are driving, pull over and park\n- Stay in the car with the seat belt on, put your head down below the windows, and cover your head with your hands and a blanket if possible\n- If you can safely get noticeably lower than the level of the roadway, exit your car and lie in that area, covering your head with your hands\n\n## If You're in a School, Nursing Home, Hospital, Factory, or Shopping Center\n\n- Go to the predetermined shelter area (interior hallway on the lowest floor, away from windows)\n- Avoid places with wide-span roofs such as auditoriums, cafeterias, and large hallways\n\n## If You're in a High-Rise Building\n\n- Go to a small interior room or hallway on the lowest floor possible"
